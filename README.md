# Usage Guide

## S.bat
`s.bat` is a temporary custom "Minecraft Launcher" that lets you select and launch your desired Minecraft version.  
(I'm currently working on creating a CMD launcher in C++, so this version may be subject to change.)

## Autoano
`Autoano` is a test file used for movement testing. Feel free to explore or modify it for your own testing purposes.

## Hack.exe
To use `hack.exe`, simply run it in the command prompt. (It generates random numbers with random colors.)

## Minecraft
To launch Minecraft, open a command prompt in this folder and type `s` (or `s.bat`). You'll be prompted to choose the version you'd like to play.
